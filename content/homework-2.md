This homework is due for the 3nd of June, 18:15 GMT+1. It should be sent to
<ad.lopez@uw.edu.pl>. Exercises are independent, and can be skipped without
penalty. Failure to deliver the homework in due time is heavily penalized. 

Please submit your homework in PDF format, and make sure to include your name
and student identifier in the document. Every exercise should be present in
your copy, if you fail to solve an exercise, please write "I couldn't solve
this exercise" and move on to the next one. 

The answers should be written in English. Please keep the answers concise and
precise. Please separate statements from proofs in your answers, and provide a
proof (even a short one) for every statement made. Handwaving proofs are not
accepted. Proofs by intimidation are not accepted. Proofs by obfuscation are
not accepted.

# Mandatory Exercises

## Invertible functions {.exercise}

Let $f \colon \Sigma^* \to \Gamma^*$ be an *injective function*.
Is it true that if $f$ is *linear regular*, then so is $f^{-1}$?
What about *polyregular*?

## Context-free languages {.exercise}

Let $L$ be a context-free language, and $f$ be a polyregular function.
Is it decidable whether $f^{-1}(L) \neq \emptyset$?

## Image Intersection {.exercise}

Let $f_1$ and $f_2$ be two polyregular functions from $\Sigma^*$ to $\Gamma^*$.
Is it decidable whether $\im{f_1}{\Sigma^*} \cap \im{f_2}{\Sigma^*}
= \emptyset$?

## Image of linear regular {.exercise}

Let $f$ be a *linear regular* function from $\Sigma^*$ to $\Gamma^*$. We define
$\mathsf{growth}_f(n)$ to be the maximum among all words $w \in \Sigma^{\leq
n}$ of the length of $f(w)$.
Prove that one of the following holds:

1. The function $\growth_f$ is *bounded*.
2. There exists a linear function $g$ such that $\growth_f \geq g$.

## For Transducers With Strings {.exercise}

We extend the definition of for-transducer to allow *string* variables that can
also be iterated over with a for-loop. Show that this computational model is
strictly more powerful than *polyregular functions*. Is it closed under
composition?

## Polyregular Reductions {.exercise}

Recall that a polyregular reduction from a problem $A$ to a problem $B$ is
a polyregular function $f \colon \Sigma^* \to \Gamma^*$ such that for all $w
\in \Sigma^*$, $w \in A$ if and only if $f(w) \in B$. 

We call $\mathsf{SAT}$ the list of satisfiable boolean formulas written over
the alphabet $\Sigma \defined \set{a, \neg, \land, \lor, (, )}$. In particular,
words $w \in \mathsf{SAT}$ are *well-bracketed* expressions, given by the
following grammar: $S \mapsto ( S \land S ) \mid ( S \lor S ) \mid \neg S \mid
L$ and $L \mapsto aL \mid a$.

We call $\mathsf{3SAT}$ the list of satisfiable boolean formulas written over
the alphabet $\Sigma \defined \set{a, \neg, \land, \lor, (, )}$, such that each
clause has exactly three literals. This is a subset of $\mathsf{SAT}$.

Construct a polyregular reduction from $\mathsf{SAT}$ to $\mathsf{3SAT}$.


# Optional Exercises üèÜ

The optional exercises are listed in the webpage
<https://aliaumel.github.io/transducer-exercices/hall-of-fame.html>. There are
plenty of exercises to choose from, and you can select any of them to solve. We
divide the number of points given by the number of contestants that provided
a solution, so choose wisely.
