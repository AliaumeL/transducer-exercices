# Sequential Functions and Mealy Machines

## Exercice 1

- lowercase 
- tabs vs spaces
- dividing by 5 in unary, in binary (reverse binary)?
- Adding two numbers in unary, binary, (reverse binary)?
- $f_a \colon u \mapsto c^{|u|_a}$
- $f_{ab} \colon u \mapsto c^{|u|_a + |u|_b}$
- $f_{ab} \colon u \mapsto c^{\min(|u|_a,|u|_b)}$
- $f : u \mapsto u u$.

## Exercice 2

Prove that the image of a sequential function is a rational language.
Similarly, prove that the image of a rational function is a regular language.

More generally, prove that a sequential function $f$ is continuous and open
for the "regular topology".

## Exercice 4

1. Write a sequential function that computes (n,4n) in binary
2. Write a sequential function that computes $n+m$ in binary 3. Deduce a sequential function that computes $5n$ in binary by using the wreath product construction

## Exercice 5

1. Can we decide if two sequential functions are equal?
2. Can we decide if a sequential function is surjective?
3. Can we decide if a sequential function is injective? (show that the kernel is a rational language)
4. Can we decide if $f(w) \sqsubseteq g(w)$ for all $w \in \Sigma^*$?
5. Can we decide if there exists $w \in \Sigma^*$ such that $f(w) = g(w)$?
6. Can we decide if a Turing machine computes a sequential function?

## Exercice 6

Is the union of two sequential functions a sequential function? (union of disjoint domains)

## Exercice 7

Prove that the following propositions are equivalent for a function $f \colon \Sigma^* \to \Gamma^*$:

1. $f$ is sequential.
2. $f$ is continuous for the regular topology AND Lipschitz for the prefix distance.
